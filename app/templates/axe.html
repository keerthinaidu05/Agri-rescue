    <div class="pruningshears-info">
        <p>Pruning shears are essential gardening tools used to trim and shape plants. They help you keep plants healthy by removing dead or overgrown branches and stems. Whether you're working on shrubs, vines, or small trees, pruning shears allow you to cut with precision, ensuring the proper growth of your plants.</p>

        <p>These tools come in various styles, including bypass pruners, anvil pruners, and ratchet pruners, each designed for different types of cutting jobs.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <b>Note:</b> Pruning shears are designed for cutting branches that are no thicker than 1 inch in diameter. For thicker branches, you may need larger tools like loppers or a pruning saw.
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Pruning Shears</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bypass Pruners:</b> These are the most common and versatile type of pruning shears. They work like scissors, with two sharp blades that bypass each other when cutting. Ideal for clean cuts on live plants.</li>
            <li><b>Anvil Pruners:</b> Anvil pruners have one sharp blade that presses against a flat surface (the anvil) to cut the plant. They are better for cutting dead wood or tougher branches.</li>
            <li><b>Ratchet Pruners:</b> Ratchet pruners have a special mechanism that allows you to cut thicker branches by applying more force with each pull. They are ideal for those who may have limited strength or need to cut thicker stems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Use Pruning Shears</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Choose the right shear:</b> Select the right type of pruning shear for the job based on the size and condition of the branches you're cutting.</li>
            <li><b>Inspect the blades:</b> Ensure the blades are sharp before use. Dull blades can damage plants and make the cutting process more difficult.</li>
            <li><b>Position the shear:</b> Position the blades so that the cutting edge is facing the plant and the flat side is facing away from it. This will make the cut cleaner and more precise.</li>
            <li><b>Make the cut:</b> For live plants, cut just above a bud or branch junction to promote healthy regrowth. For dead wood, make the cut as close to the main stem as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Safety First:</b> Always wear gloves to protect your hands from cuts and splinters while pruning.</li>
            <li><b>Clean the Blades:</b> After each use, clean the blades with a cloth to remove sap and debris. This will prevent them from becoming dull or rusting over time.</li>
            <li><b>Sharpen Regularly:</b> Sharpen the blades periodically using a sharpening stone or tool to keep them in top condition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Use Pruning Shears?</h2>
        <p>Pruning shears help you maintain healthy plants by removing dead or diseased growth, which encourages new and vibrant growth. Proper pruning also allows plants to grow more effectively by improving air circulation and light penetration.</p>

        <p>Whether you're an experienced gardener or just starting out, pruning shears are an invaluable tool for managing the health and aesthetics of your garden.</p>
